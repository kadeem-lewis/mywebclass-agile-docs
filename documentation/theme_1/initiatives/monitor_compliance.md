## Initiative 3: Monitor Compliance

### Epic 1: Set up Google Analytics tracking

Description: Set up Google Analytics tracking on the website to monitor user behavior and website performance

Goals: Obtain insights into user behavior and website performance to improve user experience and comply with GDPR regulations

**User Stories:**
As a website owner, I want to set up Google Analytics tracking so that I can monitor user behavior and website performance.
**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Google Analytics tracking code is implemented on all pages of the website
- Data is being collected and displayed in the Google Analytics dashboard

**Tasks:**

- Create a Google Analytics account and property
- Generate a tracking code for the website
- Implement the tracking code on all pages of the website
- Verify that data is being collected and displayed in the Google Analytics dashboard

**Test Plan:**

1.  Verify that the tracking code is correctly implemented on all pages of the website:

    - Navigate to each page of the website and verify that the Google Analytics tracking code is present in the page source.
    - Use a browser extension or a tool like Google Tag Assistant to verify that the tracking code is firing correctly on each page.

2.  Test user actions that will be tracked:

    - Click on various links and buttons on the website and navigate to different pages to generate pageviews and user interactions.
    - Fill out and submit forms to generate conversion tracking data.
    - Test the search functionality to generate site search data.
    - Use a test account to perform user actions like adding items to the cart, making a purchase, or logging in to generate ecommerce tracking data and user behavior data.

3.  Verify that the user data is being collected and displayed in the Google Analytics dashboard:

    - Navigate to the Google Analytics dashboard and check that the data is being collected for the specified time period.
    - Check that the correct metrics and dimensions are being displayed and that the data is being segmented correctly.
    - Verify that the data is being displayed in real-time or near real-time for the expected user actions.

4.  Use the analytics data to improve the website:
    - Analyze user behavior data to identify areas of the website that may need improvement, such as high bounce rates, low engagement, or difficulty navigating.
    - Use conversion tracking data to optimize landing pages, forms, and checkout processes.
    - Use site search data to identify popular search terms and optimize content to improve search rankings and user experience.
    - Analyze ecommerce tracking data to optimize product pages, pricing, and promotional strategies.

By testing a variety of user actions and verifying that the analytics data is being collected and displayed correctly, we can ensure that the website is compliant with GDPR regulations and that the analytics data is accurate and useful for improving the user experience.
